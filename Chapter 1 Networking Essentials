OSI model - Open system interconnect 

1. Physical     Signals and media     NICs, twisted-pair cable, fiber
2. Data link     Provides for the flow of data     MAC addresses
3. Network     Provides routing decisions     IP, IPX
4. Transport     Ensures error-free packets     TCP, UDP
5. Session     Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions     NFS, SQL6.  Presentation     Protocol conversion, data translation     ASCII, JPEG
7. Application     Support for applications     HTTP, FTP, SMTP (email)

The star network config is the most common network topology, as it minimizes both the cabling costs, 
and offers less chance of errors like from Bus topology

bus topology suffers from the possibility of simultaneous transmissions resulting in errors / packet loss

Mesh networks have the benefit of full redundancy as every networking device is connected to every other network device 
with its own cabling, this is good for applications that require full redundancy 
however it can be too costly for general networking applications as it exponentially increases set up time and 
networking hardware cost (office spaces).

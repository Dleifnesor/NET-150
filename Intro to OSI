Open systems interconnection

the way data travels through a network to and from IP addresses

A Priest Saw Two Nuns Doing Pushups

Application - the data that the computer is sending 

Presentation - Compression, encryption, other encoding

Session - Session setup and teardown

Transport - Port numbers tell receiver what application the data is meant for

Network - IP addresses of sender and receiver 

Data link - Defines how packets are sent over the layer, prevents data collisions (makes it safe to send, ie waiting to send to prevent an overflow of data)

Physical layer - How bits are physically sent over media (ethernet cables, fiber optic) 

(port 80 - HTTP, port 25 - SMPT, port 22 - SSH)

Having separation of OSI layers is helpful for troubleshooting, as it helps narrow down problems to a layer(s)

IPv4 - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 0-255
Ipv6 - xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx 0-9, A-F

Dividing protocols into layers helps to manage the complexity of a network into separate processes 

Data link - mac addresses 
internet - IP
DNS - application
TCP, UDP - transport

Layered models assist in protocol design, as protocols that operate at a specific layer have defined information that they act upon and a defined interface to the layers above and below
also prevents technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layer above and below
provides a common language to describe networking functions 

Each of the OSI layers has its own systems in place, sometimes they are integrated into one, especially with the advent of wireless communication systems

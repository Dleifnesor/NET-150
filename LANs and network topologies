(NET 150 module 2)

LAN - (local area network)
WAN - (Wide area network)
PAN - (Personal area network like bluetooth)
MAN - (Metropolitan area network)

ascending area network - nano, BAN, PAN, LAN, CAN, MAN, RAN, WAN

A LAN is a computer netowrt that interconnects computers within a limited area

Ethernet - protocol used for wired connections 
WIFI - protocol ised for wireless communication

Topologies -------
Bus topology - kinda like daisy chaining a single coax cable between several networking devices

Ring Topology - not commonly used
pros - every system gets theier turns, no collisions
cons - many systems are often idle, can be inefficient

Mesh topology - every device is interconnected with their own cable to each other
pros - highly redundant 
cons - complicated and expensive, does not scale well

Star topology - verry common in modern LANs 
pros - cable breakages only affect one node, nodes dont have to share cables to the central device
cons - uses a lot of cabling, if central device fails, the whole network goes down

Star mesh hybrid topology
pros - balance of effeciency and redundancy, star is used to connect user devices, and the backbone devices are meshed so they have a level of redundancy
